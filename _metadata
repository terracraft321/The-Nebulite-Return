  "description" : "The Nebulites are a race of ancients. They were the creators and destroyers thousands of years ago which forged the stars. One day, they witnessed an event which wasn't supposed to happen, the creation of an irregularity; the Novakids. Fascinated by this, they attempted to recreate the event, but instead they created monsters. War broke out and raged on for centuries, slaughtering many of the Nebulites. Now, what remains of the nebulites are scattered amongst the stars, preparing to fight that menace once more. Almost nobody remembers the Nebulites, as millenia have passed since that war. However the Florans, as primitive as they may seem, still have knowledge of their existence (Although other races tend to dismiss it as nonsense.).\n\nALL CREDIT GO TO : ZIMAZANG (Love the mod and will remove if asked) Link to original: https://community.playstarbound.com/resources/the-nebulites.3173/\n\n\nThe only thing different from the oringinal is the ship NAV was causing crashes.-FIXED\nI plan on working on this individually, I have no experince modding but i have takin' intrest in making this mod a bit more whole and working 100%.\nI will update as often as I can but time is needed.\n\nUpcoming: \nNew Anomaly Star type\nMore weapons and armour\nQuest\nand much more to come... soon as I figure how this stuff works!",
